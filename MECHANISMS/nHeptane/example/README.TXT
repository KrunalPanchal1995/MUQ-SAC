Input files required for the simultion are availble in the zip file (example.zip). 

1)	errors.unsrt (Uncertainty data)

3)	nheptane.mech (Reaction mechanism file in FlameMaster format. FlameMaster has the ability to convert from ChemKin format to FlameMaster format) 
4)	target_input.opt

Program can be executed by calling main code from the directory of choice as (all the 4 above mentioned files should be present in that directory. Otherwise the path name should be given in the input file [target_input.opt].)



python /path/to/the/directory/optimization/optimize.py target_input.opt







Supports FlameMaster 3.3.10. compatibility with other versions are not tested. Require Unix based Operating system.
