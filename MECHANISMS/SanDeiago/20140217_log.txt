Reaction rates, Troe fall-off parameters and Chaperon 
efficiencies have been revised for several hydrogen chemistry reactions. 
Those are detailed in the publication by A. Sanchez and F. Williams in 
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 2013.

Several changes were made to the ethanol chemistry that were detailed 
in Li at al. (2004) and Saxena et al. (2007).
A few reactions were added dealing with the C3 chemistry. Those are 
detailed in J. C. Prince et al. (2011).


San Diego Mechanism 2009/11/01 

The Frequency Factor of the reaction CH3OH + HO2 -> CH2OH + H2O2 
was changed from 6.200E+12 to 8.000E+13. This change is documented
in "Detailed and reduced chemistry for methanol ignition" 
by Seiser et al. (2011). 

San Diego Mechanism 2005/12/01 

Reactions related to combustion of ethanol are added to 
the existing San Diego Mechanism. Most of those reactions
are adopted from Juan Li, Ph.D. thesis (2004), Princeton 
University. We have also added thermodynamic and transport 
data for the additional species associated with ethanol.

San Diego Mechanism 2005/10/11

Updates are made to several sensitive reactions 
involving formaldehyde, methane, ethane, ethylene, 
acetylene and methanol, based on more recent 
literature.

San Diego Mechanism 2005/06/15- Revision as of 2005/08/17

We have edited the current thermodynamic data file to include 
several species from our previous data relevant to heptane 
reactions as well as JP10 and nitrogen chemistry.


San Diego Mechanism 2005/06/15

We have added He as an additional third body.

We revised the rates for H+O+M->OH+M step based on
results of Yetter et al. (1991). The reaction H2+O2->OH+OH
has been removed from the mechanism following recommendations
of Michael et al. (2000), Proceedings of Combustion Institute,
Vol. 28. The rate parameters are updated for the H+H+M->H2+M
step based on recommendations of Baulch (1992) where Ar is used
as a bath gas. We have also revised the prefactor in the
H+OH+M->H2O+M reaction after reviewing appropriate literature.
In addition, Chaperon efficiencies for He and Ar have been
changed in the above step as well as in O+O+M->O2+M. 
We have revised rate parameters and Troe fall-off in the 
H+O2+M->HO2+M reaction based on Troe (2000) recommendations
for the use of N2 as bath gas. We have also modified the rate
parameters in the following steps: HO2+H->OH+OH and HO2+H->H2+O2.
We have added CO+O2->CO2+O reaction to improve ignition time
calculations for the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

Finally, we have adjusted and corrected several literature
references in the mechanism.


San Diego Mechanism 2005/03/10

We have replaced the existing thermodata with the new set
to improve the calculations. In particular, we adopted the
thermodata from A. Burcat for most of the species, except 
for C3H5 and OH which are taken from H. Wang. As to the
C3H4 species, representing both allene and propyne, we
are now using allene thermodata.

A number of changes have been made in our main hydrocarbon
mechanism. The prefactor A has been increased in the
H+OH+M->H20+M to improve burning-velocity agreement. The 
third-body efficiency of water has been increased in the
H+O2+M->H02+M reaction in order to agree with new autoignition
data in wet atmospheres. We have slightly revised the rates
in the HO2+H->OH+OH reaction to improve burning-velocity
predictions for hydrogen and propane. We have added a falloff
for higher pressures for the following reaction: OH+OH+M->H202+M.
We have also revised the rates of the CH3+HO2->CH3O+OH step, in
order to improve agreement with propane autoignition times. 
We have added the CH3OH+M->CH3+OH+M step to be able to address
high-temperature methanol autoignition. We have slightly revised 
the rates for the CH2CO+H->CH3+CO reaction in order to improve 
agreement with measured propane autoignition times. 

We have revised a number of steps in the mechanism involving C3 
chemistry. These revisions enabled us to obtain better results for 
propane, propene, allene and propyne. In particular, we have included 
a falloff as well as the third body efficiencies in the propane 
initiation step C3H8->CH3+C2H5, based on the evaluation of Baulch. 
Five propyl radical steps have been included in the mechanism,
less than half of the earlier number of such reactions, because
many of them did not have appreciable influence on predictions.
In particular, we have found it very important to include falloff
in the propyl decomposition steps. As to the propene oxidation steps, 
we have retained seven of these, where the rate parameters were taken 
from Davis et al. We have also revised the parameters for propene 
autoignition steps. Of the two C3H5 isomers, we have included only 
allyl, since that appeared to be sufficient. Regarding the allyl rate 
parameters, we followed the reasoning of Davis et al. As to the 
decomposition steps C3H5->C3H4 +H and C3H5->C2H2+CH3, we have estimated 
the falloff conditions which would agree with the reported results 
by Davis, Law and Wang. With respect to the C3H5+O2->C3H4+HO2 step, 
we used the results of Bozelli and Dean for their channel to allene 
while neglecting other channels included previously. We have added 
the reactions C3H5+OH->C3H4+H20, C3H5+HO2->C3H6+02 and 
C3H5+HO2->C2H3+CH20+OH, where in the last of these we have decreased 
the rate by Baulch et al. by slightly more than a factor of two, 
to significantly improve predicted C3H8 ignition times. We have 
estimated the falloff in the C3H4->C3H3+H reaction, since we find 
it important for higher temperatures. We have added five steps 
associated with C3H3 species, in which the rate parameters follow 
recommendations of Davis et al. Rate parameters for C3H4 reactions 
are taken from Davis et al. If the same reaction was present for 
both propyne and allene, the faster rate constant of the two 
was chosen. 

Finally, we have modified the prefactor A in the following reaction:
HCCO+NO->HNCO+CO. This detail is given in our Nitrogen Chemistry
section.



San Diego Mechanism 2003/08/30-Revision as of 2004/12/09

We have added one reaction to the Nitrogen Chemistry Section
(see the appropriate section for details).
Also, we have corrected a discrepancy in the appearance of I-C3H7
species in the transport data file.


San Diego Mechanism 2003/08/30-Additon as of 2004/03/11

We have added some plots which illustrate comparison between 
computations based on our mechanism and experiments for some
fuels.

San Diego Mechanism 2003/08/30

The 3rd-body efficiency for H2O in the H+O2+M -> HO2+M
reaction has been changed from 7.0 to 12.0 as a result 
of comparisons between homogeneous, adiabatic, isobaric
induction time calculations and the recent experimental
data from Wang et al. The fall-off effect for that reaction
has been included based on the published work of Troe. 

The Troe coefficients fca and fcb in the expression for the 
fall-off effect in the N-C3H7  -> H + C3H6 reaction have been 
revised to correct the misprint which occured previously.

San Diego Mechanism 2003/04/30

The rate constants in the propene reactions: C3H6 -> C3H5 + H   
and  C3H6 -> C2H3 + CH3 have been revised by using the results 
from the published work by Davis et al. In particular, we
replaced these reactions with their appropriate counterparts 
in reverse direction, taking into consideration  the effects
of pressure dependence. The results based on revised rate
constants agree better with the laminar flame speed data. 


San Diego Mechanism 2002/10/01- Revision as of 2003/04/15

chemistry.

Additional species associated with nitrogen chemistry have been put into 
the thermodata file.

In order to insure compatability of calculations in Chemkin and Flame 
Master formats, 3-CH2 species has been renamed as T-CH2 and introduced
into both mechanism formats as well as thermodata and transport data
files. Correspondingly, 1-CH2 species has been renamed as S-CH2 and
introduced into all the formats as such.

The keyword "FC" in Chemkin format has been replaced with "TROE" for 
one reaction.

C10H16 species in FlameMaster format has been renamed as JP10-C10H16.

All {fc=} formulations in FlameMaster format have been replaced with 
{fca,fcta,fcb...} to preclude potential errors in resulting Chemkin format.

C6H5C2H, IC8H14 and CH3CHCCH species have been commented out and ANTHRACN, 
CH3CCCH2, NC5H12, IC5H12 as well as NEO-C5H12 have been removed from 
transport data file as a result of dual entry and/or redundancy.
Note: no transport data for JP-10 or C10H16 present.
