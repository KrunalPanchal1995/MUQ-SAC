  NOTE: please search "!%" to find the modified reactions, and "!%%" for the new added reactions.

  The modifications made on the n-pentanol reaction mechanism of Togbe et al.{pci,2011,367C374} are described below:

  1.The unimolecular reactions is writed in a reverse way, and the rates of them are taken from Veloo et al.{cnf,2010,1989-2004};

  2.The dehydration reaction of n-pentanol is added in reaction mechanism, and the rate of it is taken from Sivaramakrishnan et al.{jpca,2010,9425-9439};

  3.The rates of h-abstraction by the small radicals are taken from the Yasunaga et al.{cnf,2012,2009C2027} and Sarathy et al.{cnf,2012,2028C2055} for the n-butanol;

  4.Four beta-scission reactions including BC5H10OH, CC5H10OH, and EC5H10OH, were originally estimated from the analogy of a n-butanol model{Black,cnf,2010,363-373}
