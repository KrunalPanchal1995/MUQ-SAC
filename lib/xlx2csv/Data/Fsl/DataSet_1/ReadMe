-> Premixed Methonal Laminar Flame Speed
-> Atmostspheric Presure and unburned mixture temperature Tu = 343 K
-> Variation of Tu at burner walls was 2-3 K
-> Elevated unburned mixture temperature
-> Use of Digital Particle Image Velocimetry
-> Laminar flame speeds were derived through non-linear extrapolation approach based on direct numerical simulations of the experiments
-> The experimental results revealed that laminar flame speeds of ethanol/air and n-butanol/air flames are similar to those of their n-alkane/air counterparts, and that methane/air flames have consistently lower laminar flame speeds than methanol/air flames. The laminar flame speeds of methanol/air flames are considerably higher compared to both ethanol/air and n-butanol/air flames under fuel-rich conditions. Numerical simulations of n-butanol/air freely propagating flames, revealed discrepancies between the two kinetic models regarding the consumption pathways of n-butanol and its intermediates.
