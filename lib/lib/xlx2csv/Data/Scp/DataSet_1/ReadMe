-> In the study of methanol pyrolysis, experimental conditions covered temperatures of 1266–1707 K, pressures of 1.1–2.5 atm, and initial fuel concentrations of 1% and 0.2% with argon as the bath gas

-->In the case of methanol, Li et al. [8] have developed a compre-
hensive kinetic mechanism to describe the C 1 combustion chemis-
try (e.g., CH 4 , CO, CH 2 O, and CH 3 OH) that involves 93 reactions and
18 chemical species. This mechanism was validated against a wide
range of experimental data including shock tube ignition delays up
to 4.7 atm, flow reactor speciation at pressures up to 20 atm, and
laminar flame speeds at 1 atm.

--> Uncertainty -13% for CH3OH and 20% for CO
